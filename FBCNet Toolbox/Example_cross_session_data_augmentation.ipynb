        "This Google colab notebook illustrates how to employ user-specific simulated data for data augmentation in a cross-session scenario (train: session 1, test: session 2). In this example, real data consist of data from subject 27 of OpenBMI/korea dataset (Dataset 2) and simulated data comprise 100 simulated trials. FBCNet was used as decoding model and only one random seed is considered. The model is trained and tested without and with data augmentation.\n",
